# 8-Puzzle-Solver
This program asks the user to input unique numbers from 0-8 in a 3x3 grid, that will serve as the input for the 8- puzzle. The program will then utilize IDS and A* search to find the solution, solution path, solution cost, number of nodes expanded, and the running time.

*The algorithms in this program could be further optimized to remember, then ignore repeated states (pruning).*
